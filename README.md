# Minecraft²ⁿ
Minecraft²ⁿ is a datapack designed to add lots of new things to Minecraft, as well as making it harder. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/RemRemEgg/Minecraft_two_n/wiki) for more info. There is currentaly no download for the datapack, as it is stil in the early stages of development and so I haven't released a version yet.
